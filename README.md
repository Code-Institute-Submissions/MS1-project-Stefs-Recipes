This is a static front end project.

It represents what I've learned so far on my journey through [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Developer program.
I felt highly motivated to combine that knowledge with my other passion- cooking. So I created that website, which purpose is to provide an easy and tasty recipes to the user.
